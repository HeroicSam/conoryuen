                            This was a personal project I co-founded with a group of friends, with whom we spent countless hours on outside of our day jobs and during the weekends to build this vision.

                    <p>
                        Following the outbreak of COVID, the mechanical keyboard community experienced massive growth as people began working from home full-time and upgrading their home office setups for comfort and ergonomics.
                        <br><br>
                        As the first founding member and sole product designer on the team which consisted of 4 engineers and myself, I led business, product, UI, and UX strategy. 
                    </p>

                    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Transform an idea into a product.</b> Taking part in building something from the very beginning is extremely rewarding and exciting. The experience I had working on Hotswaps is something I hold very close to my heart.

                            <b>Juggled many different hats.</b> For the first eight months, it wasn’t uncommon for me to be developing wireframes, mockups, and prototypes in Figma for four to five hours a day. But with many other roles in running a startup needing filling, I dedicated many other hours to managing our product roadmap, hosting weekly scrum meetings, and creating marketing material.

                <h2>Problem Discovery</h2>
                <p class="p-margin">
                    As a keyboard hobbyist, I was frustrated by the 
                    usability issues of prominent consumer-to-consumer 
                    keyboard marketplaces. To validate these problems, 
                    I recruited 9 users, both buyers and sellers, from 
                    the most popular keyboard marketplace 
                    to interview about the pain points they 
                    experienced.
                    <br><br>
                    We found five frustrations in particular that were 
                    common among multiple participants.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pictureless item catalogs.</b> 
                        Many users feel that text-based item catalogs 
                        are inconvenient, causing window shopping to be 
                        unenjoyable and cumbersome. This leads to unnecessary 
                        clicks, making the user flow inefficient and frustrating.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Dissimilar product page layouts.</b> 
                        Due to the product listing creation process 
                        being mostly open-ended, many item pages do 
                        not share information structures even within 
                        the same item categories. Users become 
                        frustrated scanning and scrolling for relevant 
                        product information.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Biased product visibility.</b> 
                        What the item catalog shows a user upon arrival 
                        is based on Reddit’s algorithm which was originally designed for 
                        discussion and content threads. As a result, 
                        the site does not keep an ongoing 
                        inventory of available items, making it hard to 
                        determine what has and has not been sold.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Lack of a formal transaction processor.</b> 
                        Although there are recommendations on how users 
                        should conduct transactions, they are not rules 
                        meant to be enforced. This reduces the safety 
                        confidence of newer users and opens the
                        door for scam and fraud.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Diffculty gauging user trust.</b> 
                        Some users who were new to the platform felt 
                        that figuring out a buyer or seller’s reputability 
                        was a time-consuming, often fruitless process. 
                        Other users who were okay with the process felt 
                        that it could be further streamlined.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    My process for Hotswaps was based in the Double-Diamond 
                    design model. I user-tested and gathered feedback at set stages 
                    in the product roadmap to ensure that 
                    we were constantly iterating on incomplete designs and solving the actual problems 
                    users were experiencing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In devloping the site’s UX, I researched user flows of various 
                    marketplaces serving different audiences and industries to 
                    understand best e-commerce practices. For our UI, I wanted a design 
                    that was clean and minimalistic.

                    Although PayPal for Marketplaces took care of most of the heavy lifting for us,
                    we still needed to handle address selection and order confirmations on our side.
                    We opted for a simple page that allowed users to see their entire order summary 
                    and select pre-saved addresses for PayPal's automated checkout workflow.

                    Mechanical keyboards are complex items with a wide variety of types and cateogrizations. 
                    I wanted to lower the barriers to entry for sellers of all levels by making it 
                    quick and easy to get their items in front of potential buyers.

                    Balancing community and commerce is ultimately the core of Hotswaps. By accentuating price 
                    information and transparency during user interactions, our hope was that we could limit 
                    scalping and over-inflation in the market.

                <p class="p-margin">
                    Starting a startup has been one of the most difficult, yet invaluable experiences 
                    I've been a part of. Having had a hand in both building a product and managing a team,
                    I learned a lot about planning effectively and knowing the right moments and places to focus my energy.

                        <b>Focus on the MVP.</b> 
                        In a small team environment, you can find yourself taking on a lot of unanticipated responsiblity, 
                        making time management and prioritization that much more important. Don't get carried away and
                        and focus on the features solving your users' problems.

                        <b>Usability testing is Key.</b> 
                        Nothing is more telling than watching real people use your designs and go through your flows. 
                        Testing my prototypes with actual users helped cut through my hidden biases, giving me the opportunity 
                        to adjust designs before handing them off to devs.

                        <b>Understand Motivation and Morale.</b> 
                        Startups are extremely fast-paced and can be overwhelming, leading to burnout and slowed progression.
                        Paying attention to the team's culture and environment allowed me to better understand each team member's
                        personal motivations and best manage each individual's workload.
