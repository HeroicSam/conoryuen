                            This was a personal project I co-founded with a group of friends, with whom we spent countless hours on outside of our day jobs and during the weekends to build this vision.

                    <p>
                        Following the outbreak of COVID, the mechanical keyboard community experienced massive growth as people began working from home full-time and upgrading their home office setups seeking comfort and ergonomics.
                        <br><br>
                        As the first founding member and sole product designer on the team which consisted of 4 engineers and myself, I led business, product, UI, and UX strategy. 
                    </p>

                <div class="small-flex-container">
                    <h2>Key Achievements</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Transform an idea into a product.</b> Taking part in building something from the very beginning is extremely rewarding and exciting. Seeing how far we’ve come as a team and as a product is thrilling and I can’t wait to see how we change the mechanical keyboard landscape.

But with many other roles in running a startup needing filling, I dedicated many other hours to managing our product roadmap, hosting weekly scrum meetings, and creating marketing material.

                <h2>Problem Discovery</h2>
                <p class="p-margin">
                    As a keyboard hobbyist, I was frustrated by the 
                    usability issues of prominent consumer-to-consumer 
                    keyboard marketplaces. To validate these problems, 
                    I recruited 9 users, both buyers and sellers, from 
                    the most popular keyboard marketplace (a subforum 
                    of Reddit which has 265k subscribers as of writing 
                    this) to interview about the pain points they 
                    experienced.
                    <br><br>
                    We found five frustrations in particular that were 
                    common among multiple participants.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pictureless item catalogs.</b> 
                        Many users feel that text-based item catalogs 
                        are inconvenient, causing window shopping to be 
                        unenjoyable and cumbersome. This leads to unnecessary 
                        clicks, making the user flow inefficient and time-consuming.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Dissimilar product page layouts.</b> 
                        Due to the product listing creation process 
                        being mostly open-ended, many item pages do 
                        not share information structures even within 
                        the same item categories. Users become 
                        frustrated scanning and scrolling for relevant 
                        product information.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Biased product visibility.</b> 
                        What the item catalog shows a user upon arrival 
                        is based on Reddit’s algorithm which was originally designed for 
                        discussion and content threads. As a result, 
                        the site does not keep an ongoing 
                        inventory of available items, making it hard to 
                        determine what has and has not been sold.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Lack of a formal transaction processor.</b> 
                        Although there are recommendations on how users 
                        should conduct transactions, they are not rules 
                        meant to be enforced. This reduces the safety 
                        confidence of newer users and opens the
                        door for scam and fraud.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Diffculty gauging user trust.</b> 
                        Some users who were new to the platform felt 
                        that figuring out a buyer or seller’s reputability 
                        was a time-consuming, often fruitless process. 
                        Other users who were okay with the process felt 
                        that it could be further streamlined.

                <h2>Design</h2>
                <p>
                    My process for Hotswaps was based in the Double-Diamond 
                    design model. I user-tested and gathered feedback at set stages 
                    in the product roadmap to ensure that 
                    we were constantly iterating on incomplete designs and solving the actual problems 
                    users were experiencing.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    In devloping the site’s UX, I researched user flows of various 
                    marketplaces serving different audiences and industries to 
                    understand best e-commerce practices.

                    Because it was important that our brand conveyed trustworthiness 
                    to our users, I created a UI design that was clean and minimalistic.

                    My process for Hotswaps was based in the Double-Diamond 
                    design model. I user-tested and gathered feedback at set stages 
                    in the product roadmap to ensure that 
                    we were constantly iterating on incomplete designs and solving the actual problems 
                    users were experiencing.

                    understand best e-commerce practices.
