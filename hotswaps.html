                <h1>Hotswaps</h1>
                <p>
                    Hotswaps is a curated marketplace helping people buy and sell luxury mechanical keyboards, by providing an efficient, dynamic browsing experience,  cultivating community trust and assuring transactions. 
                    <br><br>
                    This was a personal project I co-founded with a group of friends, with whom we spent countless hours on outside of our day jobs and during the weekends to build this vision.

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p>
                    Following the outbreak of COVID, the mechanical keyboard community experienced massive growth as people began working from home full-time and upgrading their home office setups seeking comfort and ergonomics.
                    <br><br>
                    As the first founding member and sole product designer on the team which consisted of 4 engineers and myself, I led business, product, UI, and UX strategy.

                        <b>Transform an idea into a product from the ground up.</b> Taking part in building something from the very beginning is extremely rewarding and exciting. Seeing how far we’ve come as a team and as a product is thrilling and I can’t wait to see how we change the mechanical keyboard landscape.

But with many other roles in running a startup needing filling, I dedicated many other hours to managing our product roadmap, hosting weekly scrum meetings, and creating marketing material.

                <h3>Problem Discovery</h3>
                <p>
                    As a keyboard hobbyist, I was frustrated by the usability issues of prominent consumer-to-consumer keyboard marketplaces. To validate these problems, I recruited 9 users, both buyers and sellers, from the most popular keyboard marketplace (a subforum of Reddit which has 265k subscriberes as of writing this) to interview about the pain points they experienced.
                    <br><br>
                    We found five frustrations in particular that were common between multiple participants.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Pictureless item catalogs.</b> Many users feel that text-based item catalogs are inconvenient, causing window shopping to be unenjoyable and cumbersome. There are at minimum 2 clicks from the catalog to see what a seller’s product looks like when there could be none.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        <b>Dissimilar product page layouts.</b> Due to the product listing creation process being mostly open-ended, many item pages do not share information structures. This leads to a lot of time users can spend scanning and scrolling to find the details being sought if it’s even included at all.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>

                <h3>Reframing the Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    Through the interviews and further market research, we found that there were two main contributors to
                    negative user experience: <b>lack of design structure</b> and <b>inconvenient user flows.</b>
                </p>

            <section class="info-container">
                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    For our minimium viable product, we focused on solving these issues  through design and feature-oriented approaches.

                <h3>User Demographics Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Before wireframing and mockups, I needed to first understand who our target audience was.
                    We put together a survey, which had 95 respondents, distributed to several popular mechanical keyboard forums to gauge our potential users' demographics.

                <h3>Visual Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Studying consumer to consumer sites serving other markets allowed us to find industry standard ecommerce designs. 
                    This was a critical step because it allowed our team to uniquely tailor Hotswaps' design while
                    also maintaining best practices.
