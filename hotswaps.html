                <p>
                    Following the outbreak of COVID and transition to work from home culture, luxury mechanical keyboards
                    have turned into a rapidly growing industry with a bustling aftermarket. 
                    The goal of Hotswaps is to support this growth by bridging the gap between 
                    a now huge community and the archaic technology supporting it.

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The keyboard secondary market is made up of a handful of online forums and 
                    social media platforms designed for discussion rather than exchange in mind, 
                    causing glaring usability problems. The most popular of these is Reddit's <i>/r/mechmarket</i>, shown below.

                <h3>User Empathy</h3>
                <p>
                    I conducted user interviews to better understand the fundamental issues affecting keyboard 
                    buyers and sellers. We decided this would best give
                    give our team a holistic view of the aftermarket landscape. We recruited and 
                    interviewed four /r/mechmarket super users to gauge their behaviors and pain points.

                <h3>Solution</h3>
                <p>
                    We solved the problem using a design and feature-oriented approach. 
                    Through the interviews and further market research, we found that there were two main contributors to
                    negative user experience: <b>inconvenient user flows</b> and <b>lack of design structure.</b>

                <h3>User Stories & Design Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Before wireframing and mockups, I needed to first understand who our target audience was.
                    We put together a survey, which had 95 respondents, distributed to several popular mechanical keyboard forums to gauge our potential users' demographics.

                <h3>Visual Research</h3>
                <p>
                    Studying consumer to consumer sites serving other markets allowed us to find industry standard ecommerce designs. 
                    This was a critical step because it allowed our team to uniquely tailor Hotswaps' design while
                    also maintaining best practices.
