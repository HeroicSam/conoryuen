                <p>
                    Following the outbreak of COVID and transition to work from home culture, luxury mechanical keyboards
                    have turned into a rapidly growing industry with a bustling aftermarket. 
                    The goal of Hotswaps is to support this growth by bridging the gap between 
                    a now huge community and the archaic technology supporting it.

                <h3>Problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The keyboard secondary market is made up of a handful of online forums and 
                    social media platforms designed for discussion rather than exchange in mind, 
                    causing glaring usability problems.

                <h3>User Empathy</h3>
                <p>
                    To better understand the fundamental issues affecting keyboard 
                    buyers and sellers, our team decided that user interviews would best 
                    give a holistic view of the aftermarket landscape. We recruited and 
                    interviewed five /r/mechmarket super users to gauge their behaviors and pain points.
